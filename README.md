## Key concepts
## Snowflake
Snowflakes are `int64`s. `uint64` is not used for interoperability reasons, and to allow
for correct sorting. Snowflakes can be naturally sorted by time. The smaller the snowflake, the earlier it was created.
A snowflake can be broken down into these parts:

- 1 unused bit
- timestamp (ms) since custom epoch (customisable size)
- node id (customisable size)
- counter (customisable size)

Due to the space restrictions of an int64, the timestamp, node id and counter must share 63 bits. It is recommended to 
plan for the future: the amount of bits allocated for the timestamp should be as large as possible. A simple formula to
determine how many bits to allocate is this: `ceil(log2(years * 3,154e+10))`. `years` represents how long in the future
you wish for the ids to generate properly.
### Node
A `Node` generates IDs - it is recommended to make use of one `Node` per machine, although there are situations where it
may also be acceptable to use more.

A `Node` coordinates the generation of IDs. It maintains a counter to ensure that IDs are unique. A `Node` also stores
a custom epoch, which should be defined by the user.

## Examples
### ID Generation
The following example allocates:
- 43 bits timestamp (valid for 278.7 years + customEpoch)
- 10 bits node id (1024 nodes)
- 10 bits counter (max. 1024 snowflakes/ms/node)
```go 
node, err := snowflake.NewNode(0, customEpoch, 43, 10, 10)
if err != nil {
    panic(err)
}

id := node.Generate()
```
### Base64
Snowflakes can be converted to base64 (mathematical base using `0-9a-zA-Z+/`). This is more space-efficient than base64 because it excludes
padding.
```go 
// Snowflake to base64
s := Snowflake(4294967296)
fmt.Println(s.Base64()) // 400000

// Base64 to snowflake
s = ParseBase64("400000")
fmt.Println(s) // 4294967296
```

## Benchmarks
To test the performance on your local machine, clone this repository and run `go test -bench=.`. On an i7-8750H, it has
been observed to achieve around 35ns/snowflake.
